# Description
This side project was inspired by Star Wars Weather Forecast by Tom Scott - a Star Wars themed website meant to display a Star Wars planet associated with the weather. Unfortunately, Tom Scott's site was ended after Yahoo locked down their weather API. This site is my attempt at reimagining the concept.
# APIs
This site uses the OpenStreetMaps Nominatim API to geocode user searched locations. These coordinates are then fed into the 7Timer! API which produces weather forecasting for the given coordinates.
